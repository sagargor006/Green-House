# Green House
* Greenhouses are controlled-area-environment to grow plants.
* It is a structural building with different types of covering materials, such as a glass or plastic roof and frequently glass or plastic walls.
* Automated greenhouse involves the automatic monitoring and controlling of climatic parameters which directly or indirectly govern the plant growth and hence their production.

List of Parts & Compnonents used
1. Arduino Uno
2. NodeMCU ESP 8266
3. Soil Moisture Sensor
4. Water Level Sensor
5. DC 3-6V Mini Water Pump
6. Small 5V Cooling Fan
7. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
8. White LED
9. RGB LED
10. Relay (2 Relays are needed for this project)
11. Photo Register (LDR) Sensor
12. Buzzer

Features :
* Automatic/Manual Plant Watering mechanism
* Automatic/Manual Temperature Control mechanism
* Smart Energy Saving Light
* Remote Access using Mobile App (Blynk)

I have used Blynk to connect this project with the mobile app
